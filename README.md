# Visualization Mini Projects

The purpose of this repository is to show mini projects using any BI/chart software, mostly PowerBI and Tableau.🎥  
**What is a mini project?** ❓  
 > Well, I define mini project as charts/visualizations/dashboards where I can practice topics such as:
 - Colors 🖍  
 - Charts 📊  
 - Storytelling🧾  

Without the necessity of developing the entire analysis or cleaning in detail the data.  
This gives me the advantage to practice only specific topics without going to deep.  

## Mini projects Table of Contents

## Dashboard Ski Resorts 🎿
From the Mavens Data Challenge, this dashboard helps the user to decide the next resort.🏔  
I focused mostly on letting the user decide the options/customize.  
 >Maybe I can tell the user the best resort, but he/she will be the one that knows what he/she wants based on personal likes, family, experience, etc.

## Ways to get Protein 🥚
From the [#MakeoverMonday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/) weekly challenge, this dashboard will help you decide the best way to get protein.  
Either by amount or by price. 💲
