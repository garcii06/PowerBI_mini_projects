# Visualization Mini Projects

The purpose of this repo is to have mini projects using any BI software, mostly PowerBI and Tableau.🎥  
**What is a mini project?** ❓  
 > Well, I define mini project as visualizations/dashboards where I can practice topics such as:

Colors 🖍  
Charts 📊  
Storytelling🧾  

Without the necessity of developing the entire analysis or cleaning in detail the data.  
This gives me the advantage to practice only specific topics without going to deep.

## Dashboard Ski Resorts 🎿
From the Mavens Data Challenge, this dashboard helps the user to decide the next resort.🏔  
I focused mostly on letting the user decide the options/customize.
Maybe I can tell the user the best resorts, but he/she will be the one that says what he/she wants based on personal likes, family, experience, etc.
