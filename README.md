# Visualization Mini Projects

The purpose of this repo is to have mini projects using any BI software, mostly PowerBI and Tableau.🎥  
**What is a mini project?** ❓  
 - Well, I define mini project as visualizations/dashboards where I can practice topics such as:

Colors 🖍  
Charts 📊  
Storytelling🧾  

Without the necessity of developing the entire analysis or cleaning in detail the data.  
This gives me the advantage to practice only specific topics without going to deep.
